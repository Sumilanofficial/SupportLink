👋 Welcome to Support Link: Hands-Free Android Navigation
An innovative Android application designed to provide a seamless, hands-free way to interact with your device. Using your phone's front-facing camera and advanced facial recognition, Support Link translates your facial gestures—like eye blinks and head movements—into on-screen actions.

This application is built for accessibility, making it easier for users to perform essential tasks like making calls, sending messages, and browsing social media without ever touching the screen.




✨ Key Features
🎮 Hands-Free Control: Navigate the app's UI entirely with facial gestures.

😉 Intuitive Eye Blinking: Select options by simply winking your left or right eye.

↔️ Head Gesture Navigation: Scroll through content by tilting your head up or down.

📞 Open Call: Call your favorite contacts through a simple, gesture-based selection process.

💬 Hands-Free Messaging: Send pre-set text messages to your contacts using gestures.

🗣️ Text-to-Speech: Type a message and have your phone speak it aloud.

📲 Integrated App Control: Browse apps like Instagram and Google News using intuitive head movements.

🚀 Instructions for Use
To ensure the best performance, please follow these general guidelines before you begin.


⚠️ Important: Grant Permissions Before Use
Before you can start using Support Link, you will need to grant a few essential permissions. The app will prompt you for these when you first open it.

CAMERA: Essential for tracking your facial gestures.

CALL_PHONE: Required for the Open Call feature to place calls.

SEND_SMS: Needed to send messages via the Messaging feature.

Your privacy is important. All image processing is done in real-time and directly on your device. No images or personal data are ever stored or transmitted.




💡 Tips for Best Performance
Good Lighting is Key: Use the app in a well-lit environment. Avoid having a strong light source (like a window) directly behind you. Consistent, even lighting on your face works best.

Position Your Face: Keep your face centered in the camera's view. Make sure your entire face, especially your eyes and head, is clearly visible.

Hold Steady: Try to keep your phone in a stable position to ensure the camera can track your gestures accurately.

Make Clear Gestures: Perform blinks and head movements deliberately. Slow and clear movements are more effective than fast, jerky ones.



📱 Navigating the App Modules
Support Link's core functions are divided into modules. Here’s how to control each one:



📞 1. Open Call
This feature allows you to call pre-set contacts. The options on the screen are divided into a left half and a right half.

To Select the Left Group: Wink your right eye.

To Select the Right Group: Wink your left eye.

The app will continue to narrow down the options until only one contact remains, which will then be dialed automatically.

To Scroll Down: Blink both eyes together.

To Go Back: Close both eyes and hold them shut for 2 seconds to return to the main menu.





💬 4. Messaging
Send pre-defined messages to your contacts hands-free. This works just like the Open Call feature.

To Select the Right Group: Wink your left eye.

Keep selecting until a single message and contact option is left. The message will be sent automatically.

To Go Back: Close both eyes for 2 seconds.




🗣️ 5. Text-to-Speech (Read Aloud)
Type custom text and have the app read it out loud for you. This feature uses a gesture-based keyboard.

Wink your right eye to select the left group of characters.

Wink your left eye to select the right group of characters.
